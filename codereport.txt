Bugs:

Creating objects from main will increase the size in the text file linearly. Program will create a new copy of the information from main and add it to the file. Compiling x times will result in the same mapping to occur in the file x times.


To Do:

Maybe create a driver class so that the write() and read() method isnâ€™t in the hashing class.

Create function to removeValue() so that users can remove a coupon.
